Questions asked by client with regard to Python.

1] Difference between tuple and list.
A] Tuples are immutable and list are mutable.
2] In terms of efficiency why are tuples better?
A] Since it is non-mutable, elements cant grow beyond a fixed size, hence memory allocation doesn’t
anticipate for it grow, hence its better than list.
3] Write a simple list and tuple variable.
A] mylist=[1,2,3,4]
B] myt1=(mylist,1)
4] Here, in point 3], B] point, can we perform append operation,remove operation i.e mutable
operations to index[0]?
A] Yes its possible, be more elaborate while explaining it. Since tuple allows hetero data structure to
be present within its set, here we have list which is mutable, hence possible to do so.
5] Write a decorator which doesn’t affect the return function of parent module.
A] eg:- mention/write code with @classmethod or @staticmethod since those doesn’t affect the
return type of a method.
6] Write the below code, say what would be the output of the execution?
( write a code which takes optional parameter), then questions followed over it.
i) Write a function that accepts a variable and keyword parameters which accepts empty list.
def myfunc(val,mylist=[]):
mylist.append()
return mylist.append(val)
what will be the output of the following:-
myfunc(2) # what it will return-&gt; it will return 2, why?
myfunc(3) # what it will return-&gt; [2,3],why?
myfunc(4) #what it will return-&gt; [2,3,4],why?
Why, explain the reason?-&gt; 1] since list is created in the function, it retains it over the period until
and is not released.

7] Check for balanced parentheses in Python - GeeksforGeeks( here it was asked for generic solution
to the problem stmt)

8) what is dictionary? Explain the concept. And write a code as below for dictionary
mydict={“one”:1,”two”:2,”three”:3,”four”:4}.
Now sort it based on values in one liner.
Use sorted.
A] sorted(mydict.items(),key=lambda item:item[1])
B] How to reverse sort it?
sorted(mydict.items(),key=lambda item:item[1],reverse=True)
9) how to use a dictionary comprehension to a code?
A] write a code in dictionary comph and explain what is it.
10] What are generators and iterators?
A] Generators uses yield keyword to store the variable in persistence since no complete block of
memory is allocated to the complete list, on contrary for iterators, we have to use iter keyword
which internally uses dunder method __iter__ to generate a lists
11] Write a code to exhibit how to use generators? Sample code is enough
def myfunc():
yield stmt

for value in myfunc():
print(value)
12] Whether all generators are iterators or whether all iterators are generators? Which is true?
A] All generators are iterators and not the other way around.
13] What does __name==”___main__” represent?
A] It represent dunder method of namespace wherein its value is equal to main constructor,
whenever objects are called first.
14] Write a code to represent a generator with next()?

Day2:-
1] what will be the output:-
a=2
b=”3”
what will happen to a+b-&gt; here it will give error
what will happen when we convert it to int?

2+int(“3”)= 5
And why? Explain it with dunder method of __add__

2] sql questions-&gt; sort the employee salary dept wise and give out only top2 based on salaries?
Use :- top(2) group by order by
3] df1 has 3 cols :- “cola”,”colb”,”colc”,”cold”
Df2 has 4 cols:- “m”,”colb”,”colc”,”cold”
How to combine two dataframes into one without merge,join,concat?
4] Project q’s were asked in detail.?Why BDD?
5] pandas melt, pivot and transform questions.

HI ,

 

1. DB isolation layers

2. There are thress tables Emp table having, eid, ename, salary fields, And Depttable having did, dname fields

And EmployeeDept table having empid, deptid, one to many relationships 

Write a query to get dept name who is paying max salary in those corresponding department.

3. What types of locking is supported in DB

4. Java scenario: there is a shared account and shared across 2 people,, having tables account and balance..

2 java process,/2 users are trying to withdraw amount in different JVM altogether,, how to handle, overriden data,, data is incorrect,, how to resolve this problem!? - data inconsistency

5.How to handle across different datasource?

6.  How does transactions co ordinate with each other if they are one single object in multiple datasource

7.How to Create employee method having personal data and sensisitve data, having their own datasource,

If one fails, other should fail. How to manage transaction here!? 

8. In postmapping, how to pass json object of employee, and how it is converted to java object

1. How do you create a class in Python?
class InterviewbitEmployee:
   def __init__(self, emp_name):
       self.emp_name = emp_name

2. How does inheritance work in python? Explain it with an example.
Inheritance gives the power to a class to access all attributes and methods of another class
It aids in code reusability and helps the developer to maintain applications without redundant code. 
The class inheriting from another class is a child class or also called a derived class. 
The class from which a child class derives the members are called parent class or superclass.

Python supports different kinds of inheritance, they are:
Single Inheritance: Child class derives members of one parent class. A-->B
class ParentClass:
    def par_func(self):
         print("I am parent class function")

# Child class
class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    def child_func(self):
         print("I am child class function")

# Driver code
obj1 = ChildClass()
obj1.par_func()
obj1.child_func()


Multi-level Inheritance: A-->B-->C
# Parent class
class A:
   def __init__(self, a_name):
       self.a_name = a_name
   
# Intermediate class
class B(A):
   def __init__(self, b_name, a_name):
       self.b_name = b_name
       # invoke constructor of class A
       A.__init__(self, a_name)

# Child class
class C(B):
   def __init__(self,c_name, b_name, a_name):
       self.c_name = c_name
       # invoke constructor of class B
       B.__init__(self, b_name, a_name)
       
   def display_names(self):
       print("A name : ", self.a_name)
       print("B name : ", self.b_name)
       print("C name : ", self.c_name)

#  Driver code
obj1 = C('child', 'intermediate', 'parent')
print(obj1.a_name)
obj1.display_names()

Multiple Inheritance:   A-->c<---B  C will derive from Both A and B
# Parent class1
class Parent1:
   def parent1_func(self):
       print("Hi I am first Parent")

# Parent class2
class Parent2:
   def parent2_func(self):
       print("Hi I am second Parent")

# Child class
class Child(Parent1, Parent2):
   def child_func(self):
       self.parent1_func()
       self.parent2_func()

# Driver's code
obj1 = Child()
obj1.child_func()

-->Hierarchical Inheritance: When a parent class is derived by more than one child class, it is called hierarchical inheritance.
# Base class
class A:
     def a_func(self):
         print("I am from the parent class.")

# 1st Derived class
class B(A):
     def b_func(self):
         print("I am from the first child.")

# 2nd Derived class
class C(A):
     def c_func(self):
         print("I am from the second child.")
 
# Driver's code
obj1 = B()
obj2 = C()
obj1.a_func()
obj1.b_func()    #child 1 method
obj2.a_func()
obj2.c_func()    #child 2 meth

3. How do you access parent members in the child class?
By using Parent class name: You can use the name of the parent class to access the attributes as shown in the example below:
class Parent(object):  
   # Constructor
   def __init__(self, name):
       self.name = name    
 
class Child(Parent): 
   # Constructor
   def __init__(self, name, age):
       Parent.name = name
       self.age = age
 
   def display(self):
       print(Parent.name, self.age)
 
# Driver Code
obj = Child("Interviewbit", 6)
obj.display()
By using super(): The parent class members can be accessed in child class using the super keyword.
class Parent(object):
   # Constructor
   def __init__(self, name):
       self.name = name    
 
class Child(Parent):
   # Constructor
   def __init__(self, name, age):         
       ''' 
       In Python 3.x, we can also use super().__init__(name)
       ''' 
       super(Child, self).__init__(name)
       self.age = age
 
   def display(self):
      # Note that Parent.name cant be used 
      # here since super() is used in the constructor
      print(self.name, self.age)
  
# Driver Code
obj = Child("Interviewbit", 6)
obj.display()

4. Are access specifiers used in python?
# to demonstrate access specifiers
class InterviewbitEmployee:
   
    # protected members
    _emp_name = None
    _age = None
    
    # private members
    __branch = None
    
    # constructor
    def __init__(self, emp_name, age, branch): 
         self._emp_name = emp_name
         self._age = age
         self.__branch = branch
    
    #public member
    def display():
        print(self._emp_name +" "+self._age+" "+self.__branch)

5. Differentiate between new and override modifiers.
The new modifier is used to instruct the compiler to use the new implementation and not the base class function. 
The Override modifier is useful for overriding a base class function inside the child class.

6.  How will you check if a class is a child of another class?
This is done by using a method called issubclass() provided by python.
The method tells us if any class is a child of another class by returning true or false accordingly.
